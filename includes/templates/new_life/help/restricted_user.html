	<h1>Basic Overview</h1>
	<p>This tool is intended as a way for you to easily interact with other users and administrators, collaborating on client projects.  By uploading files and interacting with users on a per client basis, you can streamline your workflow and get more accomplished collectively.</p>
	<br /><br />

	<h1>Clients</h1>
	
	<h2>Manage My Clients</h2>
	<p>Administrators have given you access to the clients listed in the &quot;Manage My Clients&quot; area.  There are three major functions of this software : Notes, Users, and Files.</p>
	
	<p>To view or add notes to a client, choose &quot;Notes&quot;.  To view all users associated with a client and quickly send an email, choose &quot;Users&quot;.  To view or download files associated with a client and to attach a file you have already uploaded to the client, choose &quot;Files&quot;.</p>
	
	<h2>User Access</h2>
	<p>You are given access to a client on a per-client basis.  When the administrator granted access for a client, you received an email listing the date you will no longer be able access the client.  After that date, the client will no longer show up in your &quot;Manage My Clients&quot; area.</p>
	
	<br /><br />
	
	
	
	
	<h1>Files</h1>
	<h2>Uploading</h2>
	<p>Choose the &quot;Add&quot; button when viewing the your &quot;Manage My Files&quot; area.  Simply enter a title, some notes, and choose the file to upload and the rest is handled by the system.  You can easily sort by file type, size, and owner in both the &quot;Manage My Files&quot; section.
	
	<h2>Access</h2>
	<p>You have been given permission to upload files to the system.  Do not abuse it.  You can only edit files which you have uploaded.</p>
	<p>You cannot delete any file.</p>
	
	
	
	<br /><br />
	
	
	<h1>Notes</h1>
	
	<h2>Creating and Editing</h2>
	<p>Notes are company specific.  Choose &quot;Notes&quot; from the &quot;Manage My Companies&quot; area to view all notes.  Choose &quot;Add&quot; to enter a new note and share with other users.</p>
	
	<h2>User Access</h2>
	<p>A user can view all notes for a client, but can only edit notes he has posted.  A user can never delete a note.</p>
