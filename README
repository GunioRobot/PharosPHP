Main features include:
	- Robust template system, similar to RoR for quickly creating/editing/updating/deleting (CRUD) content
	- Several built in classes, for easily managing content (ie, TableController)
	- Lots of bundled modules, like SWFUpload, jQuery, PHP Quick Profiler, RMail and more
	- Extensible module system, allowing module developers to interact with core system actions (similar to WordPress Plugin Development)
	- Easy to get started quickly
